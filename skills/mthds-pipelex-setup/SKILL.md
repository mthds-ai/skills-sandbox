# Set Up Pipelex Inference Configuration

Guided setup for configuring the Pipelex runtime with inference backends and API keys. This is only needed to **run** methods with live inference — building, validating, editing, and dry-running work without any configuration.

## Process

### Step 0 — CLI Check (mandatory, do this FIRST)

Run `mthds-agent --version`. The minimum required version is **0.1.3** (declared in this skill's front matter as `min_mthds_version`).

- **If the command is not found**: STOP. Do not proceed. Tell the user:

> The `mthds-agent` CLI is required but not installed. Install it with:
>
> ```
> npm install -g mthds
> ```
>
> Then re-run this skill.

- **If the version is below 0.1.3**: STOP. Do not proceed. Tell the user:

> This skill requires `mthds-agent` version 0.1.3 or higher (found *X.Y.Z*). Upgrade with:
>
> ```
> npm install -g mthds@latest
> ```
>
> Then re-run this skill.

- **If the version is 0.1.3 or higher**: proceed to the next step.

### Step 1 — Check Pipelex Runtime

Run `pipelex-agent --version` to check if the Pipelex runtime is installed.

- **If not installed**: Tell the user:

> The Pipelex runtime is not installed. Install it with:
>
> ```
> curl -fsSL https://pipelex.com/install.sh | sh
> ```
>
> Or alternatively: `pip install pipelex`

Wait for confirmation, then proceed.

### Step 2 — Assess Current State

Run `mthds-agent pipelex doctor` (outputs markdown) to check the current configuration health.

- **If healthy** (backends configured, credentials valid): Tell the user their setup is already complete. Suggest trying `/run` on a method.
- **If issues found**: Show the doctor output and proceed to Step 3 to fix them.

### Step 3 — Choose Backends

Ask the user which backends they want to configure. Two paths:

#### Option A — Pipelex Gateway (simplest)

The Pipelex Gateway provides access to multiple AI models through a single API key.

1. Ask the user: "Do you accept the Pipelex Gateway Terms of Service and Privacy Policy? See: https://www.pipelex.com/privacy-policy"
2. If they accept: run `mthds-agent pipelex login` to log in to Pipelex and configure the `PIPELEX_GATEWAY_API_KEY`. This command handles authentication and key setup automatically.
3. If they decline: proceed with Option B instead

#### Option B — Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

The user provides their own API keys for individual providers.

1. Ask which providers they want to enable. Common options: `openai`, `anthropic`. Run `mthds-agent pipelex init --help` to discover all available backends.
2. If 2+ backends are selected, ask which should be the `primary_backend`.

### Step 4 — Telemetry Preference

Ask the user: "Do you want anonymous telemetry enabled?"

- `"off"` — no telemetry
- `"anonymous"` — anonymous usage data

### Step 5 — Apply Configuration

**You MUST have all answers from Steps 3-4 before running this command.**

Build the JSON config and run:

```bash
# Example: Pipelex Gateway (user accepted terms):
mthds-agent pipelex init -g --config '{"backends": ["pipelex_gateway"], "accept_gateway_terms": true, "telemetry_mode": "anonymous"}'

# Example: BYOK with OpenAI only:
mthds-agent pipelex init -g --config '{"backends": ["openai"], "telemetry_mode": "off"}'

# Example: BYOK with multiple backends:
mthds-agent pipelex init -g --config '{"backends": ["openai", "anthropic"], "primary_backend": "anthropic", "telemetry_mode": "off"}'
```

- `-g` targets the global `~/.pipelex/` directory. Without it, targets project-level `.pipelex/` (requires a project root).
- Config JSON schema: `{"backends": list[str], "primary_backend": str, "accept_gateway_terms": bool, "telemetry_mode": str}`. All fields optional.
- When `pipelex_gateway` is in backends, `accept_gateway_terms` must be set.
- When 2+ backends are selected without `pipelex_gateway`, `primary_backend` is required.

### Step 6 — Set API Keys (BYOK only)

If the user chose BYOK (Option B), guide them to set environment variables for their chosen backends:

- **OpenAI**: `export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."`
- **Anthropic**: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."`

Recommend adding these to their shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.) for persistence.

After the user confirms they've set the keys, run `mthds-agent pipelex doctor` again (outputs markdown) to verify everything is healthy.

### Step 7 — Confirm Success

Once the doctor reports a healthy configuration:

1. Confirm the setup is complete
2. Suggest trying `/run` on a method to test the configuration

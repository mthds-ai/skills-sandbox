# Check MTHDS bundles

Validate and review MTHDS bundles based on the MTHDS standard without making changes.

## Process

### Step 0 — CLI Check (mandatory, do this FIRST)

Run `mthds-agent --version`. The minimum required version is **0.1.3** (declared in this skill's front matter as `min_mthds_version`).

- **If the command is not found**: STOP. Do not proceed. Tell the user:

> The `mthds-agent` CLI is required but not installed. Install it with:
>
> ```
> npm install -g mthds
> ```
>
> Then re-run this skill.

- **If the version is below 0.1.3**: STOP. Do not proceed. Tell the user:

> This skill requires `mthds-agent` version 0.1.3 or higher (found *X.Y.Z*). Upgrade with:
>
> ```
> npm install -g mthds@latest
> ```
>
> Then re-run this skill.

- **If the version is 0.1.3 or higher**: proceed to the next step.

Do not write `.mthds` files manually, do not scan for existing methods, do not do any other work. The CLI is required for validation, formatting, and execution — without it the output will be broken.

> **No backend setup needed**: This skill works without configuring inference backends or API keys. You can start building/validating methods right away. Backend configuration is only needed to run methods with live inference — use `/mthds-pipelex-setup` when you're ready.

1. **Read the .mthds file** — Load and parse the method

2. **Run plxt lint** — Catch TOML syntax and schema errors before semantic validation (this skill is read-only and never triggers the PostToolUse hook, so lint must be run explicitly):
   ```bash
   mthds-agent plxt lint <file>.mthds
   ```
   If lint reports errors, include them in the final report and continue — semantic validation in the next step may reveal additional issues.

3. **Run CLI validation** (use `-L` pointing to the bundle's own directory to avoid namespace collisions; `--graph` generates a flowchart):
   ```bash
   mthds-agent <runner> validate bundle <file>.mthds -L <bundle-directory>/ --graph
   ```

4. **Parse the JSON output**:
   - If `success: true` — all pipes validated, report clean status
   - If error — see [Error Handling Reference](../shared/error-handling.md) for error types and recovery

5. **Cross-domain validation** — when the bundle references pipes from other domains, use `--library-dir` (see [Error Handling — Cross-Domain](../shared/error-handling.md#cross-domain-validation))

6. **Analyze for additional issues** (manual review beyond CLI validation):
   - Unused concepts (defined but never referenced)
   - Unreachable pipes (not in main_pipe execution path)
   - Missing descriptions on pipes or concepts
   - Inconsistent naming conventions
   - Potential prompt issues (missing variables, unclear instructions)

7. **Report findings by severity**:
   - **Errors**: Validation failures from CLI (with `error_type` and `pipe_code`) and plxt lint errors
   - **Warnings**: Issues that may cause problems (e.g., model availability)
   - **Suggestions**: Improvements for maintainability
   - **Flowchart**: If validation succeeded, mention the generated `dry_run.html` flowchart next to the bundle

8. **Do NOT make changes** — This skill is read-only

## What Gets Checked

- TOML syntax and schema validation (via `mthds-agent plxt lint`)
- Concept definitions and references
- Pipe type configurations
- Input/output type matching
- Variable references in prompts
- Cross-domain references
- Naming convention compliance
- Model preset resolution (dry run)

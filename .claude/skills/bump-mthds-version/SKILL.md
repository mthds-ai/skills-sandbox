# Bump Minimum mthds-agent Version

This skill updates the `min_mthds_version` across all plugin skills in a single coordinated operation.

## Workflow

### 1. Determine the new version

Ask the user for the target version (semver `X.Y.Z`) unless they already specified it.

Show the current canonical version by reading line 3 of `skills/shared/mthds-agent-guide.md` — it contains `mthds-agent >= X.Y.Z`.

### 2. Update the canonical source

Edit `skills/shared/mthds-agent-guide.md` line 3. Replace both occurrences of the old version:

- `mthds-agent >= OLD` → `mthds-agent >= NEW`
- `` below `OLD` `` → `` below `NEW` ``

### 3. Update all SKILL.md files

**Important**: Read each `skills/*/SKILL.md` file before editing it (the Edit tool requires a prior read).

For each file matching `skills/*/SKILL.md`, replace all 5 occurrences of the old version with the new version. The old version string is specific enough to use `replace_all` safely — there are no other occurrences of it in these files.

**Strategy**: Use the Edit tool with `replace_all: true` to replace `OLD` → `NEW` in each file. This covers all 5 patterns in one operation:

1. **Frontmatter**: `min_mthds_version: OLD`
2. **Body — bold version**: `**OLD**` (in "minimum required version is **OLD**")
3. **Body — below check**: `below OLD` (in "If the version is below OLD")
4. **Body — version requirement**: `version OLD or higher` (in "requires `mthds-agent` version OLD or higher")
5. **Body — version gate**: `is OLD or higher` (in "If the version is OLD or higher")

### 4. Update the test constant

Edit `tests/unit/test_check.py` and replace the `CANONICAL = "OLD"` line with `CANONICAL = "NEW"` (using the actual old and new version strings). The test fixtures derive all version strings from this constant via f-strings, so updating it is sufficient.

### 5. Verify with grep

Run `grep -rc 'OLD' skills/*/SKILL.md skills/shared/mthds-agent-guide.md` (replacing `OLD` with the actual old version string). Every file must return `:0`. If any file still contains the old version, fix it before continuing.

### 6. Verify with `make check`

Run `make check` from the repo root. This validates shared refs, shared file existence, frontmatter version consistency, and body-text version consistency. If it fails, report the errors and fix them before continuing.

### 7. Report

List all modified files and show the version change: `OLD → NEW`.
